This is a .Net library for interacting with the Untappd API.

In order to use the enclosed console test app or the unit tests, you need to place a file in the project root called "secrets.txt".  A post-build action moves this file next to the binary.  The file must contain 3 lines:

apikey|<your Untappd API key>
username|<username of the Untappd user you're logging in as>
password|<password of the Untappd user you're logging in as>

Example:
apikey|c0ffeec0dec5deadbeefb05535decade0
username|mycoolusername
password|myawesomep4ssword
